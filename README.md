iBlock
======

iBlock is a machine learning video game!

This game is played on a 8x6 board (48 spaces) and the goal is to fill up the enemy's column with your pieces! Once that happens the game will reset and log all the data for the AI's to observe! In the first few games the AI will take random moves and attempt winning. Once one of the AI's win, the information on how they one gets processed and they try to attempt it again using that information!

Rather then focusing on attacking, these AI naturally plays offensively! You will see them defend their base while at the same time try to attack the enemy!
The AI also doesn't know which spaces it must fill to win so as it plays it must learn on it's own (this also allows for the creation of custom maps).

iBlock has multiple different game options for how to set up the way the AI will play! New gamemodes coming soon!
